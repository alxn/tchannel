> The icon is itself a T, though the vertical bar is broken. The icon
> is a depiction of four TChannel messages. The beam at the top of the
> T is blocking the head of the line, so it gets fragmented into two
> packets, and the dashed segment is the period where the message is
> pending on the wire, allowing three other small messages to be
> transmitted concurrently. The x axis is of course time. The y axis
> is messages by id, in no particular order, or rather, in incorrect
> order the better to resemble the broken trunk of the T. Each message
> is divided in three “arguments”. I’ve always assumed the T in
> TChannel stood for 3.
